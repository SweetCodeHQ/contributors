# Fixate Rules and Process

## EXTERNAL REPRESENTATION:

* If software or services are required in order to complete content, Fixate will procure directly on behalf of the Contributor.

* The Contributor will not directly or indirectly solicit Fixate customers on-behalf of their employer for free or discounted software or services on the basis of content generation. This does not prevent standard negotiations by the Contributor or Contributor’s employer.

* Contributors may share their content and involvement as a direct Contributor of Fixate on social media profiles and in conversation.

* Contributors will not re-purpose content in part or whole without direct approval from Fixate.

* The Contributor may post a summary of the content on their blog or social media forums and link back to the original.

* Any none Fixate created content the Contributor may write will not replicate content created for Fixate. This excludes themes,and concepts.

* Contributors may represent themselves as a “Contributor” for Fixate IO on bios and social media profiles. Including adding themselves as part of the Fixate IO company on LinkedIn

## CONTENT GENERATION AND APPROVAL PROCESS:

The content generation and approval process is as follows:

### TOPIC AND CONTRIBUTOR SELECTION

* TOPIC CREATION AND SELECTION: Creation and selection of Topics (working titles and abstracts / thesis statements)  are coordinated with the client. The process can vary from time to time. The ideal process is for Fixate to request input from  its contributors for working titles and abstracts on Topics in their Field and interest. Fixate then compiles a list of suggested topics, and presents them to the client. The client can accept, modify, or reject any individual topic, and may offer their own suggestions.

* TOPIC CREATION: After topics are accepted they are setup as cards in Trello in the “Pending” list. At this point Contributors can point out any topics that particularly interest them to write about. And they will be given priority for assignments.

* CONTRIBUTOR SELECTION: After topics are accepted, they are set up as cards in Trello, on the “Vendor Content” board. Contributors are given priority first-right-of-refusal for any Topics they suggested and those cards are placed in the “Assigned” column on the Trello board. Otherwise, the cards are placed in the “Available” column and any contributor can request any Topic that interests them, and that they are qualified to write about.

Selection of contributors per topic is based on the best match of quality (determined from previous posts), topic expertise that matches the client, and style that the client is looking for. When a topic is assigned the contributor will be added to the Trello card and be given access to a Google Doc where the contributor will place the final copy. The Topic card is moved to the “Assigned” list.


### CONTENT CREATION

* CONTENT VOLUME COMMITMENTS: Contributors are not obligated to accept any topic. When a contributor accepts a topic they are expected to complete the draft within one week of accepting the topic. If the contributor passes on the post after acceptance, or misses a deadline more than twice in two months, they will no longer be eligible to participate in the network.

* CONTENT CREATION: Once a contributor is selected they will create the content in the editor of their choosing.The Contributor should move the Card they are assigned to, to the “In Progress” list in Trello. The Contributor should review the abstract on the Trello card and the content guidelines in the assigned Google Doc to help guide content creation.

* CONTENT SENSITIVITY: Content should be free of opinions, product promotion, slander, or mention of competitive products to the customer. Content with any of the above can be edited prior to acceptance to meet these criteria.

* CONTENT CREATION SUPPORT: During the content creation process Fixate is available for coaching, question and answer, and any assistance to complete the content.

* PEER SUPPORT: At any point in time the contributor can reach out to the Fixate network for support. Fixate prefers that all content-related conversations happen in the Fixate Slack account.

* AUTHORED CONTENT: Authored content is content that is published with the contributor's name, title, bio, and photo. The most common example is a blog post. This content is attributed to the author and all content therein represents their opinion.

* NON AUTHORED CONTENT: Non-authored content is content such as Whitepapers and eBooks. This content will not be attributed to the author when published, and will be paid at a rate determined case by case.

### REVIEW PROCESS

* PEER REVIEW: When draft content is completed, the contributor moves the assigned Trello card to the “Peer Review 1” column. In the peer review, two or more contributors will check content for technical accuracy, match to abstract, and general interest. A Peer Review score (1 - 10, with 10 being perfect) is then entered in the score grid at the top of the Google Doc. After the reviewer completes their review, they move the Topic card to the “Peer Review 2” column, where the process is repeated. After Peer Review 2, the reviewer moves the card to the Technical Review column. 

* COPY EDITING: Copy editing is the process of reviewing the content for type-o’s, spelling, grammar, and flow. The meaning of the content will not be changed but structure and some language may be.

* FORMAT/SEO REVIEW: After the copy editor has finished editing the content, it is moved to the “Format/SEO Check” column on the Trello board. At this stage the content is checked against a focus keyword (a keyword that will be targeted for searches). When there are opportunities to inject the keyword, that will be done. The post is formatted for consistent typeface and header conventions.

### DELIVERY PROCESS

Conteent is delivered in the following steps:

* Once all drafts in the content cycle (i.e., all pieces of content per the agreement with the client) are delivered to the client.

* The Topic card is staged for accounting and payment to the Contributor.  

* Client feedback is monitored via activity in the Google Doc. Clients will make edits that are generally minor and stylistic, and do not change the meaning of the content.

* Contributors will be tagged if/when the feedback requires their response (e.g., needs additional information; editing and re-wording for clarity and accuracy, etc.) Contributors have five working days to respond in the original Google Doc, and tagging the Customer Liaison to trigger the second review by the client.

* The client will schedule the post for publishing on their blog or location of their choosing. All content will be published with the bloggers byline, and bio, unless otherwise noted in the abstract on the Trello card. 

* After the completed and delivered content is recorded for payment to the Contributor, the Topic card is moved to the “Published Posts” Trello board.

### CONTENT ACCEPTANCE

* CONTENT REJECTIONS: From time to time content gets rejected. Content rejections can come from Fixate or Fixate customers. Ninety percent of the time rejections are from clients and based on direction changes or missed expectations on topics; not on the quality of content. Contributor will be paid for rejected content. Fixate will maintain copyright for rejected content and may choose to publish on another forum of their choosing.

### PUBLISHING

* After the content is published (and if Fixate is notified by the Client), Fixate adds the  URL to the Topic card. Contributors should set their Trello notifications so they can be alerted when one of their pieces of content is moved to the “Published on Client Site” column on the “Published Posts” Trello board.  The network is encouraged to share the content when it fits with their network, but this is not a requirement.

* Fixate and or Fixate client own copyright of all accepted content. Therefore,content cannot be republished in whole by the contributor, and the contributor cannot stake claim to the content’s distribution.

* Fixate and or Client may choose to syndicate content on one or more forums including the client’s blog or other media outlet.

* To the extent that it is possible, it is recommended that contributors subscribe to feeds where content is published; monitor and respond to any comments placed on content they have created.

## CODE OF CONDUCT

* We encourage free and open conversation amongst contributors about the market and technology. Our contributor network is there to be a resource and motivator for everyone to produce better technical content. If you feel like a peer contributor has breached a boundary of etiquette, we ask that you bring it to our attention immediately, and avoid engaging directly with the offender.

* Fixate's priority is good technical content. We only measure our contributors on the quality of their content. A contributor's personal opinions should not be reflected in their content. Any and all interactions with the public outside the scope of published content is up to the discretion of the contributor. Any controversies resulting from those interactions by the contributor will not be associated with Fixate or Fixate's customers to the extent that is possible.
